# Muhammed Muzzammil Shah - AI Software Engineer

## About Me

Hello! I'm Muhammed Muzzammil Shah. I design and engineer intelligent systems by leveraging LLMs and integrating AI architectures. I like implementing practical AI solutions, whether it's developing AI-powered chatbots, agentic systems, or adding intelligent capabilities to existing software.

My expertise includes AI architectures and techniques like Agentic AI, RAG and prompt engineering, and I enjoy working with frameworks such as PyTorch, Hugging Face, and LangChain. I also have a good foundation in full-stack development, with skills in Python, React.js, and REST APIs.

I'm dedicated to expanding my knowledge and sharing what I learn through my [Road to AI documentation](https://docs.muhammedshah.com/). Feel free to explore it as I share what I learn about AI in clear, practical terms.

## Work Experience

### Potentiam Ltd
#### Junior AI Software Engineer
*Sept 2024 - Present*

Building and optimizing applications using LLMs or SMLs for different departments and also integrating AI architectures for secure, scalable deployment. Currently working on upgrading these systems to include agentic components.

#### AI Trainee Engineer
*Sept 2023 - Sept 2024*

Collaborated directly with the Global CIO and Founder on AI-driven initiatives, focusing on open source AI R&D, pilot implementations and cybersecurity operations.

### Wipro Ltd
#### AI Intern
*Mar 2023 - Jun 2023*

Developed a pilot for interactive data insight conversations and researched AI observability, ML monitoring, root cause analysis, anomaly detection, and capacity forecasting.

## Work Projects

### Private Enterprise GPT
Designed, configured, and deployed a secure in-house Private GPT system on Ubuntu with Nginx reverse proxy, SSL, and custom domain mapping. Integrated Microsoft OAuth authentication to ensure access only to company users, automated backend services for resilience, and enabled GPU powered remote access via VNC. Migrated all AI interactions in-house, ensuring full data privacy and operational reliability.

### AI Search
Developed an AI powered search widget with an "Ask AI" feature for instant, accurate querying of company salary and HR data, leveraging a RAG system with FAISS embeddings, LangChain orchestration, and Llama3.x models. Optimized embedding accuracy, reduced hallucinations, and introduced caching for speed, deploying the solution as a JavaScript widget via IIS for seamless internal integration.

### Intelligence Framework
Engineered an all-in-one intelligence framework for HR and Talent Acquisition, featuring a LLM driven resume reviewer, job spec generator, chatbot, and resume formatter with advanced UI and batch processing. Utilized local LLMs via Ollama, LangChain pipelines, and MongoDB for fast, secure, and accurate candidate evaluation, automation, and internal data generation.

### Chatbot Development
Led the creation of an advanced company chatbot widget, powered by a proprietary SLM trained on internal data and later enhanced with LLM (Ollama) fallbacks. Delivered features like file downloads, speech-to-text, custom UI, and robust conversational management. Migrated from Rasa Open Source to Rasa Pro CALM for advanced context switching and ensured scalable, low latency responses for dynamic business needs.
